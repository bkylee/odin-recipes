So far, I've completed up to this current lesson - Project: Recipes. 

I've learned a lot more than I have than at school. Hands-on learning and not feeling the pressure to learn before deadlines has improved my motivation and focus when studying. 

I've learned about git, git hub, navigating the commmand line, and the structure of websites using HTML + CSS + Javascript.

Best practice of using git is to do several git add + git commit cyces before being ready to push it up to to GitHub with git push origin main 
- Commit early and often
